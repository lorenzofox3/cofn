# todomvc example

The famous todo app. 

From a technical point of view, it is built with typescript to show how you can integrate your components. 
There are various component patterns (even though they may not be the more appropriate to the situation):
* declarative views
* connected services
* with shadow dom
* extending built-in elements
* etc
