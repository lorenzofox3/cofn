# Restaurant cashier

A _large_ single page app to emulate the user interface a agent could have to operate in a food shop. 

It solves most of the problematics you can get while building a single page app:
* client side routing and page transition when supported
* full keyboard accessibility
* notifications
* backend sync with optimistic updates
* form and custom validation
* user preferences management (theme, animation)
* advanced components (select list, file upload with drag and drop)
